# Closest_Points_Calculations
This algorithm determines the closest two points together and prints out the points and their respective distance apart. First, points are sorted by their x values using merge sort. The dividePoints() method is then called which recursively divides the points array into smaller sub components based on the midpoint of the array/sub components. X values that are less than the minimum of the two sub components are appended to a centralPoints array for later use. Once the subcomponents are less than or equal to 3 elements in size, a brute force method is called to determine the distance. At the end of the dividePoints() method, the minimum is returned, which calls the lineClosestCalc() method.
